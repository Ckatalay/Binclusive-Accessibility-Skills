name: audit-accessibility
description: Audit React, Next.js, ASP.NET, ASPX/Web Forms, SwiftUI, or UIKit accessibility from a prior Binclusive project map. Use when the user says /auditaccessibility, audit accessibility, run accessibility audit, accessibility test, iOS accessibility audit, SwiftUI accessibility audit, UIKit accessibility audit, "binclusive projemi test et", "erişilebilirlik testi yap", "erişilebilirlik todo çıkar", "accessibility todo çıkar", or wants an accessibility TODO report from mapped routes, views, screens, components, controls, or paths. Also use to audit a single target only, e.g. "/auditaccessibility LoginButton", "audit only the X component", "sadece X componentini test et", or when a component/screen/folder name is passed as an argument — narrow the audit to that target from the existing map.

# Audit Accessibility

Audit a previously mapped React/Next.js, ASP.NET/ASPX, or iOS SwiftUI/UIKit scope and write an actionable accessibility TODO report. This skill observes and documents only. It never edits source code.

## Start Here

1. Locate `Binclusive-auditing/` in the project root.
2. If no map file exists, stop and ask the user to run `map-project` or `/mapaccessibility` first.
3. If multiple map files exist, summarize them and ask which map to audit unless the user named one.
4. Read the selected `*_project-map.md` end to end.
5. Detect framework/platform/language from the map. Read only the references that match the mapped scope:
   - For React/Next.js web, read:
     - `references/auditor-web-a11y.md`
     - `references/react-nextjs.md`
     - `references/patterns/react-nextjs-patterns.md` when available
   - For ASP.NET MVC/Razor or ASPX/Web Forms, read:
     - `references/auditor-web-a11y.md`
     - `references/aspnet-aspx.md`
     - `references/patterns/aspnet-aspx-patterns.md` when available
   - For iOS SwiftUI/UIKit, read:
     - `references/ios-swift.md`
     - `references/patterns/ios-swift-patterns.md` when available
6. For mixed-platform maps, keep findings grouped by platform/surface and do not apply web-only rules to native iOS UI or iOS-only rules to web UI.
7. Determine focus scope before auditing (see "Focus Scope" below).
8. Write `Binclusive-auditing/accessibility-todo.md` and also archive a dated copy: `accessibility-todo_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.

## Focus Scope

The map sets the outer boundary; within it the audit can run over everything mapped or narrow to one target.

1. **Use a named target when given.** If the user passed a component, screen/page, control, or folder path — as a `/auditaccessibility <target>` argument or in their request (e.g. "audit only the LoginButton") — audit only that target plus the usages the map records for it.
2. **Otherwise ask once:** "Audit the whole mapped scope, or narrow to a specific component, screen/page, or folder path?" Default to the whole mapped scope if the user does not specify.
3. **Resolve the target against the map. Do not invent it.** If the named target is not in the selected map, list the closest mapped entries and ask the user to pick one, or to run `map-project` for that target first. Never silently fall back to auditing the whole project when a narrow target was requested.
4. **Narrowing is always allowed; expanding is not.** You may scope down to any subset of the mapped areas freely. Only audit beyond the map with explicit user approval.
5. **Record it.** Put the exact focus scope in the TODO header `Scope audited` field, and note when it was narrowed from a broader map (e.g. `LoginButton (narrowed from full project map)`). Keep stable `TASK-00x` ids scoped to this run.

## Required Output

Use the TODO format in `references/accessibility-todo-format.md`. Every finding must include:

- stable task id (`TASK-001`, etc.)
- component/page/screen/control, file path, usage context
- severity: Critical, Serious, Moderate, Minor
- fix type: `SAFE`, `VISUAL-IMPACT`, `FUNCTIONAL-RISK`, or `RUNTIME-CHECK`
- exact code snippet or enough verified code/storyboard/xib context
- problem, WCAG/APG/platform impact, correct solution, verification steps
- status: `TODO`

## Audit Order

For web scopes:

1. Inline interactive UI in pages/views.
2. Shared interactive components: Button, Link, Input, Select, Dialog, Drawer, Popover, Menu, Tabs, Accordion, Carousel, Toast.
3. Shared display components: Image, Icon, Avatar, Table, Chart, Skeleton, Loading, Badge.
4. Page-level patterns: landmarks, headings, skip link, route focus, page title, language/locale, reduced motion, zoom/reflow.

For iOS scopes:

1. Inline interactive UI in SwiftUI views, UIKit controllers, cells, and storyboard/xib scenes.
2. Shared interactive controls: Button, NavigationLink, TextField, Picker, Toggle, Slider, Stepper, Sheet/Dialog, Menu, Tab, custom gesture targets, custom UIControls.
3. Shared display components: Image, SF Symbol/Icon, Avatar, List, Table, Collection/Grid, Chart, Map, Skeleton, Loading, Badge, Toast/Banner.
4. Screen-level patterns: navigation titles, headings, focus/reading order, modal presentation/dismissal, errors, status updates, localization, Dynamic Type, Reduce Motion, RTL, contrast, touch targets.
5. Platform assistive technology behavior: VoiceOver, Switch Control, Voice Control, Full Keyboard Access, Dynamic Type, Button Shapes, Differentiate Without Color, Increase Contrast.

## Rules

- User-provided audit documents may be read as inspiration only; do not copy customer data into skill resources.
- Do not modify source code.
- Do not include accessible elements as findings.
- Do not guess contrast, screen-reader/VoiceOver output, focus trap/focus order behavior, touch target size, Dynamic Type layout, or runtime state. Mark these `RUNTIME-CHECK`.
- Prefer native HTML fixes for web and native SwiftUI/UIKit controls/APIs for iOS.
- Do not claim compliance; report verified findings and residual risk only.
- If the map has blind spots, carry them into the audit summary.
