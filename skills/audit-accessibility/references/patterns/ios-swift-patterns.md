## Seed Patterns

### PATTERN-IOS-001: Gesture-only SwiftUI control
- Platform: iOS
- Framework: SwiftUI
- Component type: Button-like custom control
- WCAG / Platform: WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard, WCAG 4.1.2 Name/Role/Value, VoiceOver activation
- Severity default: Critical
- Fix type default: FUNCTIONAL-RISK
- Bad shape: A `Text`, `Image`, `HStack`, `VStack`, `ZStack`, or custom view uses `onTapGesture` as an action control without native button/navigation semantics.
- Detection hints: `.onTapGesture` on non-control views; missing `Button`, `NavigationLink`, accessibility label, traits, and activation behavior.
- Correct fix: Prefer `Button` for actions and `NavigationLink` for navigation. If a native control is impossible, expose accurate label, role/traits, state, and custom activation behavior.
- Verification: VoiceOver reaches the element, announces name and role, and activates it with the standard gesture; Full Keyboard Access/Switch Control should also reach it.
- False positives / exceptions: Do not flag passive gesture areas when an inner native control is the actual accessible target and the container gesture is redundant/delegated.

### PATTERN-IOS-002: Icon-only control without accessible name
- Platform: iOS
- Framework: SwiftUI | UIKit
- Component type: Icon button / toolbar item / bar button item / row action
- WCAG / Platform: WCAG 4.1.2 Name/Role/Value, VoiceOver, Voice Control
- Severity default: Serious
- Fix type default: SAFE when adding a localized label; FUNCTIONAL-RISK when changing control structure.
- Bad shape: A button, toolbar item, image-based control, SF Symbol, or custom icon action has no meaningful accessible name.
- Detection hints: `Image(systemName:)` inside `Button`; `UIButton` or `UIBarButtonItem` with only an image; missing `.accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityLabel`, localized title, or label text.
- Correct fix: Provide a localized accessible name that describes the action or content, and hide decorative icons from assistive technologies when needed.
- Verification: VoiceOver announces the intended action and role; Voice Control can target the control by a meaningful name.
- False positives / exceptions: Do not add an accessibility label that conflicts with visible text; prefer the visible localized title when one exists.

### PATTERN-IOS-003: Field uses placeholder as its only label
- Platform: iOS
- Framework: SwiftUI | UIKit
- Component type: TextField / SecureField / TextEditor / UITextField / UITextView
- WCAG / Platform: WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, WCAG 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions, VoiceOver forms
- Severity default: Serious
- Fix type default: SAFE
- Bad shape: An input relies on placeholder/prompt text as the only field name, so context may disappear after entry or be unclear in review mode.
- Detection hints: `TextField("Email", text:)` without nearby persistent label in SwiftUI; `UITextField.placeholder` without `accessibilityLabel` or visible label in UIKit.
- Correct fix: Provide a persistent visible label or a programmatic label tied to the field context; connect help/error text through clear nearby text, announcement, or field-level accessibility description where appropriate.
- Verification: VoiceOver announces the field name, value, role, and relevant help/error context before and after text entry.
- False positives / exceptions: Search fields and compact controls can be acceptable when a clear localized programmatic label remains available.

### PATTERN-IOS-004: Dynamic Type clipping risk
- Platform: iOS
- Framework: SwiftUI | UIKit
- Component type: Text / Button / Cell / Card / Form row
- WCAG / Platform: WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text, Dynamic Type
- Severity default: Serious
- Fix type default: RUNTIME-CHECK by default; VISUAL-IMPACT when layout changes are required.
- Bad shape: Text or controls use fixed heights, clipped containers, absolute frames, one-line assumptions, or custom fonts that may not scale at accessibility text sizes.
- Detection hints: SwiftUI `.frame(height:)`, `.lineLimit(1)`, clipped overlays; UIKit fixed constraints, custom font sizes without text styles, labels with insufficient lines.
- Correct fix: Use scalable text styles, flexible layout, multiline support, minimum scale only when appropriate, and test at large accessibility sizes.
- Verification: Runtime check with large accessibility Dynamic Type sizes confirms text, controls, and focus outlines remain usable without clipping or overlap.
- False positives / exceptions: Do not flag fixed-size decorative text that is not user-facing or accessibility-relevant.

### PATTERN-IOS-005: List or collection cell has unclear VoiceOver summary
- Platform: iOS
- Framework: SwiftUI | UIKit
- Component type: List row / UITableViewCell / UICollectionViewCell / Card
- WCAG / Platform: WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and Labels, VoiceOver reading order
- Severity default: Moderate
- Fix type default: RUNTIME-CHECK when final cell output is dynamic; SAFE when label/value composition is obvious.
- Bad shape: A row/card contains multiple visual labels, values, icons, and actions, but the accessible order or summary is fragmented, missing important values, or hides available actions.
- Detection hints: custom cells, nested SwiftUI stacks in `List`, `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)`, reused cells, row swipe/context actions.
- Correct fix: Provide a coherent row label/value strategy, expose separate interactive children when needed, and add custom actions for row actions that are otherwise gesture-only.
- Verification: VoiceOver reads representative cells in a meaningful order and exposes all actions without requiring visual gestures.
- False positives / exceptions: Do not over-combine cells that contain multiple independent controls; preserve separate controls when each has its own action.

### PATTERN-IOS-006: Color-only state or status
- Platform: iOS
- Framework: SwiftUI | UIKit
- Component type: Badge / Status / Validation / Chart / Selection
- WCAG / Platform: WCAG 1.4.1 Use of Color, Differentiate Without Color, Increase Contrast
- Severity default: Serious
- Fix type default: VISUAL-IMPACT
- Bad shape: Status, selection, validation, chart categories, or availability are communicated only through color.
- Detection hints: color-coded badges, `.foregroundColor(.red)` errors without text/icon, chart legends by color only, selected state shown only by tint.
- Correct fix: Add text, icon shape, pattern, state, or accessible value that communicates the same information without relying on color alone.
- Verification: Inspect visually with Differentiate Without Color/Increase Contrast where applicable and verify VoiceOver announces the state.
- False positives / exceptions: Color can remain as redundant reinforcement when text, icon shape, or accessible state already communicates the meaning.

## Interface Builder (Storyboard / XIB) Patterns

Storyboards and XIBs are XML. Audit the markup directly (read the `.storyboard`/`.xib` file), and treat the paired `Base.lproj` file plus per-locale `<lang>.lproj/<Name>.strings` as the localization source — IB accessibility strings are keyed by the element's object ID (for example `<objectID>.accessibilityLabel = "..."`). Each element's accessibility config lives in a child element of this shape:

```xml
<button id="aB3-cd-9Xy" userLabel="Submit">
    <accessibility key="accessibilityConfiguration" label="Submit order">
        <accessibilityTraits key="traits" button="YES"/>
        <bool key="isElement" value="YES"/>
    </accessibility>
</button>
```

Ground every storyboard finding in a real element. Quote its `id` and, when present, its `userLabel` so a fix can target the exact object and its `.strings` key. Mark rendered reading order, Auto Layout results, and reused prototype-cell output as `RUNTIME-CHECK`.

### PATTERN-IOS-007: Storyboard control missing accessible name
- Platform: iOS
- Framework: UIKit (Interface Builder)
- Component type: button / barButtonItem / segmentedControl / imageView used as control / custom view class
- WCAG / Platform: WCAG 4.1.2 Name/Role/Value, VoiceOver, Voice Control
- Severity default: Serious
- Fix type default: SAFE when adding a localized label to an existing element; FUNCTIONAL-RISK when changing element type or structure.
- Bad shape: An interactive element has no visible title and no `<accessibility ... label="...">`, or its only title is an image/SF Symbol. Icon-only `<button>`/`<barButtonItem>` is the common case.
- Detection hints: `<button>`/`<barButtonItem>` with `image=` and no `title`/`<string key="title">`; element with no child `<accessibility>` element or an `<accessibility>` element with no `label` attribute and no localized `<objectID>.accessibilityLabel` in any `.lproj/*.strings`.
- Correct fix: Add `<accessibility key="accessibilityConfiguration" label="...">` with an action/content-oriented name, and add the matching `<objectID>.accessibilityLabel` entry to each locale's `.strings` so the label is localized. Add `<accessibilityTraits key="traits" button="YES"/>` when the role is not already a native control.
- Verification: VoiceOver announces the intended name and role; Voice Control can target it by that name.
- False positives / exceptions: Do not add a label that duplicates a visible localized title; prefer the visible title. A native `<button>` with a localized `title` already has a name.

### PATTERN-IOS-008: Informative image not exposed / decorative image not hidden
- Platform: iOS
- Framework: UIKit (Interface Builder)
- Component type: imageView
- WCAG / Platform: WCAG 1.1.1 Non-text Content, VoiceOver
- Severity default: Serious
- Fix type default: SAFE
- Bad shape: An informative `<imageView>` has no accessible label, or a purely decorative `<imageView>` is exposed to VoiceOver instead of being hidden.
- Detection hints: `<imageView>` carrying meaning with no `<accessibility>` label; or decorative `<imageView>` with `<accessibility>` `<bool key="isElement" value="YES"/>` (or default-exposed) when it conveys nothing.
- Correct fix: For informative images add a localized `label` (+ `.strings` entry). For decorative images set `<bool key="isElement" value="NO"/>` inside the `<accessibility>` element so VoiceOver skips them.
- Verification: VoiceOver describes informative images and skips decorative ones.
- False positives / exceptions: Do not hide an image that is the only carrier of information; do not label background decoration.

### PATTERN-IOS-009: Storyboard input field has no persistent label
- Platform: iOS
- Framework: UIKit (Interface Builder)
- Component type: textField / textView / searchBar
- WCAG / Platform: WCAG 1.3.1, WCAG 3.3.2, VoiceOver forms
- Severity default: Serious
- Fix type default: SAFE
- Bad shape: A `<textField>`/`<searchBar>` relies on `placeholder` as its only name, with no adjacent `<label>` wired as its accessible context and no `<accessibility>` label.
- Detection hints: `<textField ... placeholder="...">` with no nearby `<label>` describing it and no `<accessibility>` label/`.strings` entry; localized placeholder used as the sole field name.
- Correct fix: Provide a persistent visible `<label>` or an `<accessibility>` `label` tied to the field's purpose, localized via `.strings`. Keep placeholder as a hint, not the name.
- Verification: VoiceOver announces the field name, role, and value before and after entry.
- False positives / exceptions: A compact search field can be acceptable when a clear localized programmatic label remains.

### PATTERN-IOS-010: Hardcoded storyboard accessibility/visible text (not localized)
- Platform: iOS
- Framework: UIKit (Interface Builder)
- Component type: any labeled element
- WCAG / Platform: Localization, WCAG 3.1.x context
- Severity default: Moderate
- Fix type default: SAFE
- Bad shape: An `<accessibility label="...">` or visible `title`/`text` is a literal string in the storyboard with no corresponding entry in the locale `.strings` files, so it never translates.
- Detection hints: literal `label=`/`title=`/`text=` in a project that otherwise localizes via `Base.lproj` + `<lang>.lproj/*.strings`, with no matching `<objectID>.<attribute>` key in those `.strings` files.
- Correct fix: Move the string into each locale's `.strings` keyed by object ID (`<objectID>.text`, `<objectID>.accessibilityLabel`), keeping Base Internationalization consistent.
- Verification: Switch locale at runtime and confirm the visible and accessible text both change.
- False positives / exceptions: Single-locale apps with no localization setup — record as a localization-readiness note instead of a defect. Do not flag IB-internal `userLabel` (design-time only, never shown to users).
